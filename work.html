						<p class="detailText">DIA2 - Deep Insights Anytime, Anywhere - is a data visualization tool for researchers, students and NSF program officers. The DIA2 team has put the users at the center of our design process to make NSF's records as accessible as possible.</p>
						<p class="detailText">By the time I joined DIA2's technical team as a front-end developer, the design team had already developed three personas. These personas had emerged from affinity diagrams and are based on a collection of focus groups.</p>
						<p class="detailText">Based on these personas, I worked with the design team to create a new homepage for DIA2. We updated the homepage to advertise DIA2's functionality and the problems it will solve for our users.</p>
						<p class="detailText">After implementing our first design for the homepage, I worked with the design team to design to map out a task flow for users and design our login and registration forms for DIA2 users.</p>

						<h2 class="detailName">Virtual Student Transitioning, Advising, and Registration</h2>
						<p class="detailText">STAR - Purdue University's orientation program for incoming undergraduate students - provides an opportunity for new students to get help with setting up their class schedules.</p>
						<p class="detailText">For international students who do not have the resources to travel to Purdue for orientation before classes start, Purdue provided an online program to provide the same information.</p>
						<p class="detailText">As part of a class in user centered design, two teams of students were tasked with conducting our own user research to redesign VSTAR to better meet the needs of international students.</p>
						<p class="detailText">Each team started with a heuristic analysis of the VSTAR program in use before the Fall of 2014. We conducted our analysis with an adaptation of Nielsen's heuristics for online applications.

						<p class="detailText">Our two teams collaborated to conduct three interviews - one with a student who participated in STAR at Purdue, one who used VSTAR, and one academic advisor. Two interviewers were present at each interview to take notes and observe our participants. We also gave students from the provided mailing list to fill out a brief questionnaire.</p>
						<p class="detailText">Using the notes from our interviews, we created an affinity diagram and were able to find one persona. With this persona, we were able to create two scenarios for VSTAR and a set of user requirements.

						<p class="detailText">After fleshing out our design requirements, we began ideating, starting with sketches on our own. After sharing our conceptual sketches and discussing our ideas, we divided our design into four distinct models. Finally, we created a set of wireframes in Balsamiq to begin testing with.

						<p class="detailText">We refined our wireframes to create higher fidelity paper prototypes for a series of usability tests. We recruited three high school students and two international Purdue students for our usability tests. We rotated at least three of our team members between the roles of cameraman, moderator, and "Wizard of Oz," managing the paper prototype.

						<p class="detailText">At the end of the project, we submitted our reports to the administrators responsible for STAR and VSTAR.</p>
